Jagger Zlotoff: I didn't learn a ton in this iteration
because I've already done most of this in CS3300 but it
was great review and will definitly help me going forward. 
The one thing I did learn was how to start working with a 
group using github. I've never had to merge someone elses 
work with mine so it was good practice.
